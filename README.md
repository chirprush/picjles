# Picjles

*(All right, maybe naming isn't my strong suit, but cut me some slack)*

## What is it?

Just having some fun using the Javascript canvas and programming in a functional style. I mostly plan on doing things related to pixels and/or pixel art drawings.

## How do I use it?

You can try out a live demo [here](https://chirprush.github.io/picjles/)!

### Desktop User Controls
- Hold or tap the left mouse button to draw in the selected color
- Hold or tap the right mouse button to erase
- Press the `c` key to clear the screen
- To switch colors, simply click one of them in the toolbar (the dark bar on the top of the screen)

### Mobile User Controls
- Drag or tap your finger to draw in the selected color
- Drag or tap your finger on a cell with the same color as the one you have selected to enter erase mode. From there, as long as you keep holding your finger down, you will erase. Once you lift your finger and draw again, the previously selected color (the one before erasing) will be your current draw color
- The best way to clear the screen for mobile is to reload the page
- To switch colors, tap one of them in the toolbar (the dark bar one the top of the screen)

## Does it have X feature?

If the feature isn't listed above, it probably has not been implemented yet. If you would like to see it added to this, though, feel free to submit an issue (no promises, obviously)!
